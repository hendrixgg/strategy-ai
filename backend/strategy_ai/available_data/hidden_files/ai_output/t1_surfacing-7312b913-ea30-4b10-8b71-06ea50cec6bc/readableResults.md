2. Enhance Training and Development Programs: Invest in training and development programs to enhance the skills and capabilities of the existing workforce. This can include providing opportunities for employees to learn new technologies, improve their job-related skills, and advance their careers within the company.

3. Strengthen Recruitment Efforts: Develop effective recruitment strategies to attract top talent. This can involve leveraging technology and automation to streamline the recruitment process, partnering with educational institutions and industry associations, and implementing targeted marketing campaigns to reach potential candidates.
