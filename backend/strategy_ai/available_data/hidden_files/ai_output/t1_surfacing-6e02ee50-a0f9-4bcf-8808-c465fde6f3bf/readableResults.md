Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any specific objectives addressing Attracting, Retaining, and Developing Talent. However, I can provide some relevant suggestions based on the context:

1. Improve Staffing and Retention: Develop strategies to attract and retain qualified personnel, such as offering competitive salaries, benefits, and career development opportunities. Implement programs to recognize and reward employees to increase morale and job satisfaction.

2. Enhance Training and Development Programs: Invest in training and development programs to enhance the skills and capabilities of the existing workforce. This can include providing opportunities for employees to learn new technologies, improve their job-related skills, and advance their careers within the company.

3. Streamline Recruitment Processes: Improve the recruitment processes to ensure efficient and effective hiring of quality employees. This can involve implementing technology solutions, streamlining interview and selection processes, and establishing partnerships with educational institutions or job placement agencies.
