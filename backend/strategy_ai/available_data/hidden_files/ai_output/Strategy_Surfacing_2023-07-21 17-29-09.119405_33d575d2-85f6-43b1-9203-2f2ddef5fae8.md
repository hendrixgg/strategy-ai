Based on the available context, I couldn't find any specific objectives addressing building a climate for action. However, I can provide some relevant suggestions based on the context:

1. Improve Communication: Enhance communication across the company to ensure that plans are executed as intended and to foster a climate of action. This can be achieved through regular meetings, clear communication channels, and effective use of technology.

2. Increase Production: Focus on increasing production capacity to fulfill backorders and improve service levels. This can involve implementing production automation, finding ways to eliminate bottlenecks, and investing in new technologies or processes.

3. Employee Recognition and Morale: Recognize the value of long-term employees and implement employee recognition programs to increase morale and create a positive climate for action. This can include initiatives such as employee appreciation events, rewards and incentives, and fostering a sense of teamwork and shared goals.
