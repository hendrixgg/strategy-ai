This could involve establishing distribution centers, forging partnerships with retailers and carriers, and implementing aggressive marketing campaigns. These actions may require additional resources such as hiring sales and marketing teams, logistics personnel, and support staff.\n\n- The company may also need to invest in research and development (R&D) to innovate and introduce new products, as mentioned in the first context result. This could require hiring more employees in the R&D department.\n\n- In terms of regulations, the company needs to ensure compliance with Canadian regulations, as mentioned in the fourth context result. Specific regulations related to hiring and employment practices may need to be followed.\n\n- It is not mentioned in the available information what similar things competing businesses have done to increase headcount. Therefore, we cannot provide specific examples of actions taken by competitors.\n\nOverall, without specific information about the company's plans or actions related to increasing headcount, it is difficult to provide detailed answers to the questions regarding the impact, additional resources required, regulations, and actions taken by competitors."
