Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any specific objectives addressing attracting, retaining, and developing talent. However, I can provide some relevant suggestions based on the context:

1. Improve Staffing and Retention: Develop strategies to attract and retain quality employees, such as implementing competitive compensation packages, offering career development opportunities, and creating a positive work culture.

2. Succession Planning: Establish a succession plan to ensure a smooth transition of key roles and responsibilities within the organization. This can involve identifying high-potential employees, providing them with training and development opportunities, and creating a clear career progression path.

3. Enhance Training and Development Programs: Invest in training and development programs to enhance the skills and capabilities of employees. This can include providing ongoing training, workshops, and mentorship programs to support their professional growth and development.

Please note that these suggestions are based on the context provided and may not reflect the actual objectives of the company. It is recommended to refer to the specific documents or sources for more accurate information on the company's objectives.
