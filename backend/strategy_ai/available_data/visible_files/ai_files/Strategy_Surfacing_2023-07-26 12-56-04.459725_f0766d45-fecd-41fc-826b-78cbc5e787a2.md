Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any specific objectives addressing Attracting, Retaining, and Developing Talent. However, I can provide some relevant suggestions based on the context:

1. Improve Staffing and Retention: Develop strategies to attract and retain qualified personnel, such as offering competitive salaries, benefits, and career development opportunities. Implement programs to recognize and reward employees to increase morale and job satisfaction.

2. Enhance Training and Development Programs: Invest in training and development programs to enhance the skills and capabilities of the existing workforce. This can include providing opportunities for employees to learn new technologies, improve their job-related skills, and advance their careers within the company.

3. Strengthen Recruitment Efforts: Develop effective recruitment strategies to attract top talent. This can involve leveraging technology and automation to streamline the recruitment process, partnering with educational institutions and industry associations to identify potential candidates, and promoting the company's values and culture to attract candidates who align with the organization's vision.

Please note that these suggestions are based on the context provided and may not directly reflect the company's specific objectives.
