This could involve establishing distribution centers, forging partnerships with retailers and carriers, and implementing aggressive marketing campaigns. These actions may require additional resources such as hiring more employees in sales, marketing, and logistics departments.\n\n- The company may also need to invest in research and development (R&D) to introduce new products and innovations, which could potentially lead to increased headcount in the R&D department.\n\n- In terms of regulations, the company needs to ensure compliance with Canadian regulations, as mentioned in the fourth context result. Specific regulations related to hiring and employment practices may need to be followed.\n\n- It is not mentioned in the available information what similar things competing businesses have done to increase headcount. Further information would be needed to provide insights into the actions of competing businesses in this regard.\n\nOverall, without specific information about the company's plans or actions related to increasing headcount, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the questions regarding the impact, additional resources required, regulations, and actions of competing businesses."
