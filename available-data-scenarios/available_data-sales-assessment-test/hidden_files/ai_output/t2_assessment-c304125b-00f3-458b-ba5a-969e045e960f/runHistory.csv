Therefore, it is not possible to provide specific points regarding what the company is doing or planning to do to increase headcount.\n\nHowever, based on the context provided, we can make some general observations:\n\n- To increase headcount, the company may need to focus on expanding its operations, such as market expansion and penetration (mentioned in the context).

These actions may require additional resources such as hiring sales and marketing personnel, logistics staff, and support teams.\n\n- The regulations that need to be followed would depend on the specific country or region where the company plans to expand its operations. For example, if the company plans to expand in the US, it would need to comply with relevant labor laws and regulations.\n\n- It is difficult to determine the impact of increasing headcount without more specific information about the company's previous years' performance and its competitors' actions. However, increasing headcount can potentially lead to increased productivity, improved customer service, and the ability to handle higher demand.
